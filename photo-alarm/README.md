## ðŸ“¸ Photo Alarm

A simple **Photoresistor-based Alarm System** that makes noise when exposed to light.  
This project demonstrates how a light-dependent resistor (LDR) can be used to trigger a buzzer when light is detected.

### ðŸ”¹ Working Principle
- Uses a **Light Dependent Resistor (LDR)** to sense light.  
- When light falls on the LDR â†’ resistance drops â†’ current flows â†’ buzzer turns ON.  
- In darkness â†’ resistance is high â†’ buzzer remains OFF.

With Increase with light intensity, noise intensity increased while simulated in tincketcad.

### ðŸ”¹ Components Used
- Photoresistor (LDR)  
- Buzzer  
- Resistors  
- Power supply (battery)  

### ðŸ”¹ Applications
- Detecting sudden light exposure (e.g., flashlight in a dark room).  
- Simple burglar/tamper alarm.  
- Educational demo for light-controlled circuits.
