## ðŸ”Š Function Generator (LM324 Based)

A low-cost **Function Generator** circuit designed using the **LM324 operational amplifier**.  
The circuit is capable of generating **sine, square, and triangular waveforms** at variable frequencies.

### ðŸ”¹ Working Principle
- The LM324 op-amp is configured to operate as an oscillator.  
- Different stages of the circuit generate:
  - **Square Wave** â€“ directly from the op-amp oscillator output.  
  - **Triangular Wave** â€“ obtained by integrating the square wave.  
  - **Sine Wave** â€“ shaped from the triangular waveform using a wave-shaping network.  

### ðŸ”¹ Features
- Generates **Sine, Square, and Triangular** signals.  
- Frequency range adjustable by tuning RC components.  
- Simple, affordable design using widely available components.
